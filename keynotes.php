				<h3>Steve Curtis</h3>
        
        <p>Steve Curtis shares his vision from a challenging childhood, to becoming a self-made millionaire by 22, only to be diagnosed with terminal cancer shortly after. </p>

        <p>He takes you on the journey of how this curse, became the greatest gift of his life and he shares stories of his challenges, wild successes, excruciating failures and this vision of the positive global change they inspired. </p>

        <p>Steve confronts the uncertainty of the future of humanity and shares his personal vision of possibilities, challenging us all to take action to create a new future for humanity. </p>

        <p>It will be fast paced, raw, action inspiring and will most certainly challenge the beliefs you hold about yourself and the world.</p>

        <h3>About Steve</h3>
				<p>Investor, entrepreneur, adventurer and revolutionary thought leader. Steve travels the world sharing the knowledge he has amassed overcoming adversity both personally and professionally, and his vision on how we can evolve to shape and create a better future. </p>

        <p>Raised by a low-income single mother, Steve started his first business at 19 with a $500 credit card and grew it into a business with a half-billion dollar valuation before he sold it. </p>

        <p>His career trajectory changed radically at age 24 when he was diagnosed with a terminal cancer for which there was no cure and only 2 years left to live. Steve hired an MD, built a research team and traveled the world to develop a cure. From researchers at global expert centers like Yale and Stanford to healers and shamans in far-off jungles, he sought to cure the incurable. Learning he couldn’t make a drug fast enough, he followed the trail of “spontaneous remission," setting the prognosis-defying goal of summiting Everest instead. Five years later, he had done both. Healing without the use of any modern medicine, he was left with unquestionable truth and a vision for changing medicine globally. </p>

        <p>He has become an influential thought leader in international politics and has influenced the lives of millions of people through the products he has created. His venture capital business is advancing new perspectives in science, medicine and technology with investments in AI, quantified self, VR, AR, spiritual science, block-chain, and psychedelic medicine.  Steve regularly shares his story on global stages and he and his organizations have been covered in 100’s of publications including NYT, WSJ, CNN, MSNBC, CBC, CTV, TGM and Reuters International.</p>
