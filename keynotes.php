				<h3>Leah Goldstein</h3>
        
        <p class="lead">What happens when a girl doesn’t believe in limitations? What is possible when her dreams resonate at such a frequency that they 
        force themselves into reality? Practically anything - as proven by Leah Goldstein’s stunning example of how to live an unbounded life. </p>
        <p>Prepare to hear the story of how Leah overcame limits to become a champion – battling bullies, sexism, terrorism, and more. Leah will 
        share intimate details of how she dealt with fear, loneliness, and anger by tapping into her strong work ethic and overwhelming drive 
        to succeed. By age 17, Leah was the World Kickboxing Champion. Shortly thereafter, she enlisted in the Israeli Military and became one
        of the few female instructors of the elite Commando division, specializing in Krav Maga. Leah then transitioned into a Special Forces 
        unit, combating terrorism and violent crime. The extreme lifestyle of the secret police eventually took its toll, and she found her 
        salvation on a bicycle. She convinced Israel to release her from duty, as she pursued a brilliant 10-year career as a professional 
        cyclist in Europe and North America – and eventually to the longest single stage race in the world, Race Across America. From crashes 
        to podiums and fear to triumph, Leah’s story gives us a glimpse of what’s truly possible in a life without limits.</p>
        <p>Leah Goldstein is a renowned speaker, author, and co-owner of No Finish Line Living, a wellness company dedicated to inspiring and 
        educating people on how to live their best life.</p>
