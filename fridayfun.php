                        shooting for the moon.</p>
                    <p>Winston Yeung is the founder and host of VoiceStory Live, a live monthly storytelling event in
                        Vancouver that is entering its third year in 2020. He has helped over 100 speakers (including
                        many Toastmasters) develop, reflow, and present their stories.</p>
                    <p>While working with speakers in developing their stories, Winston has noticed a pattern that we,
                        at times, focus too hard on what we want our lives to be like, based on our perceptions,
                        beliefs, and conditioning.</p>
                    <p>During those times, all other possibilities cease to exist as we become blind to them. If we can
                        become aware of this, let go of the control of “what we want...” what stories could possibly
                        begin to unfold?</p>
                    <p>What could your life be like?</p>
                    <p>Winston invites you to come and hear why he feels you are limiting yourself by only shooting for

                    <p>A small idea can become a life-changing event for you. It can also change the lives of tens of
                        thousands of people when you believe in yourself and your story. During our one-year, 80-country
                        journey, I gave presentations in over 60 countries and was interviewed by over 100 TV stations
                        (including CBC, CTV, NBC, and the BBC) and print newspapers. Our film, Around The World in 80
                        Anthems, was narrated by Shark Tank's Emmy Award winner Daymond John. It won multiple awards at
                        festivals around the world. We still hold the official Guinness World Record for my daughter
                        singing 80 national anthems in 80 countries in their home languages.</p>
                    <p>In 2002, Toastmasters changed my life. It turned me from an extremely nervous and visibly shaking
                        speaker into a confident, humourous, passionate human being. Since then, I have led a very
                        successful life as a realtor, home renovator, parent and traveller. These skills were put to the
                        test during our one-year, 80-country trip around the world.</p>

                    <p>Mai was born, raised, and educated in the Philippines. Like a true flamenco gypsy,
                        she has lived in different places to pursue things that her heart dictates. </p>
                    <p>Mai started her love affair with flamenco dancing when she went through a very
                        challenging moment in her life. She finds that this dance is a powerful living form
                        of art that allows her to express raw emotions. Mai is the mother of two girls who
                        also love dance, as they took ballet at an early age. She is looking forward to
                        sharing the stage with them someday</p>
                    <p>Mai works in the competitive financial industry and finds that life can sometimes be
                        difficult. Flamenco dancing helps her keep her sanity and balance. Toastmasters, on
                        the other hand, is her platform for honing her writing, public speaking, and
                        leadership skills. Life is short, so she intentionally lives it with PURPOSE and
                        SIGNIFICANCE.</p>

                    <p>Arthur has been a Toastmaster since 1991. He has invited many guests to speak at his
                        club, Seymour Speakers--from Peter Legge (an entrepreneur and philanthropist) to
                        Olga Katelco (a 94-year-old athlete who ran and threw the discus 13 meters).</p>
                    <p>At 59, Arthur started running and formed a Seymour Speakers Vancouver Sun Run team.
                    </p>
                    <p>He has now changed his focus to Track & Field. In 2010, when the World Indoor Meet
                        was in Canada, a miraculous thing happened. He forgot to take off his warmup pants,
                        but he still threw a discus over 32 meters, coming in second only to the competitor
                        from Japan, who finished with a throw of 34 meters. He earned a silver medal at the
                        2010 World Indoor Masters Athletic Championships.</p>
                    <p>Arthur has always loved to dance. In high school, he spent a lot of time at the
                        Arthur Murray dance studio.</p>

                    <p>Kyriaki was born and raised in Greece. Belly dancing is part of her Mediterranean heritage. From

                        made. As a little girl she started to mimic the dancers, mirrored Arabic videos and as she grew
                        older began to improvise by watching video clips of the world-famous dancer, Shakira. After
                        moving to Canada, Kyriaki gave volunteer performances at several conferences. Last summer she
                        participated and performed in Egypt’s biggest belly dance festival, the Ahla wa Sahla.</p>
