				<h2>Gratitude is the Key to Optimism, Health and Happiness</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Understand the relationship between gratitude, optimism and happiness.</li>
          <li>Explore benefits of gratitude on health and wellness.</li>
          <li>Identify ways to incorporate gratitude into daily life.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It’s easy to be optimistic when the sun is shining, your relationships are rewarding, and you’re healthy… But, what happens when we lose our job or a loved one, break a leg or get overwhelmed by life’s challenges, as we all do from time to time. Thoughts like “Why is this happening to me?” “Why me?” or “What did I do to deserve this?” send us spiralling downward into negative victim-land where it’s dark and lonely. It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of despairing and wondering if there’s light at the end of the tunnel, you can overcome the darkness with your own light; a torch called Gratitude that will always show you the way!</p>

        <p>Tracey Purvis has a passion for helping and serving others. She has over 20 years experience in health care as a registered psychiatric nurse in a wide range of settings.
        As a “brain tumour and 4x brain surgery” survivor, Tracey knows what overcoming adversity is all about. As a speaker, she wants to share that with the world, to inspire those that struggle with their own adversities, to see beyond their obstacles and count their blessings.</p>
