				<p class="lead">Being an entrepreneur means that one is on a constant journey of self and business discovery.</p>

				<p>Entrepreneurs are asked to step outside their comfort zone, to take on challenges, learn new things, and reach greater heights. In order to achieve success, they must build their brand in a way that speaks of who they are authentically and one that attracts their ideal clients. The biggest risk is when they do not know how to do this well and miss opportunity after opportunity.</p>
        <p>Contradictory to popular belief, branding is not your logo, website, or marketing collateral. Understanding the true definition of branding will ignite how entrepreneurs can use it to their advantage. Introducing the out-of- the-box idea that a business's clients or customers are not buying products or services from the business. What they are in fact buying is an idea and a brand promise. Often, entrepreneurs make the mistake of focusing too much on their own end-game and forget to turn the focus on the perspective of their ideal target market. Discovering the ONE THING that an audience actually buys into will give way to define a company's brand, positioning, story, and ultimately how people connect with that business. It's quite empowering! Take a risk … get to know your unique brand.</p>			 
        <p>Participants will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>learn definition of branding and its importance in business,</li>
          <li>discover the concept of the ONE IDEA,</li>
          <li>determine one’s own ONE IDEA,</li>
          <li>learn to shift perspective toward the target market's gain,</li>
          <li>learn to use the 20-80 rule,</li>
          <li>learn strategies of successful companies and what they can model from them,</li>
          <li>understand the journey and risks entrepreneurs take in order to live their mission and achieve success.</li>
        </ul>
				<h3>About Azadeh</h3>

        <p> Fear and regret are two dragons that shadow and stalk us from a young age. Most of our fears are self-instilled; we talk ourselves into feeling and fueling them. When fear grips us, we take the low road to safety and end up with regrets. But effective leaders know that it doesn’t have to be that way. They know that bravery and courage are not just the nemesis of fear; they are the mastery of fear. And risk-taking is the master key that opens doors to possibilities you never thought you could unlock.</p>
        <p>This is your journey. Your one good shot on this beautiful planet. Don’t go out with memories of what might have been. Stop playing it safe and living a little less. Take risks. Slay the dragons of fear and regret! Reap your just rewards. You can do it! And Sharookh can show you how.</p>
        <p>In this interactive, playful and engaging workshop, you will learn to change your story &mdash; and your life &mdash; by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>learning the difference between taking and managing risks,</li>
          <li>reframing your mindset and your self-talk,</li>
          <li>learning how to be brave and courageous.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will also be encouraged to find an accountability partner to support you to do something you have been too scared to do.
